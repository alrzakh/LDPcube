# LDP³

This repository contains a snapshot of the code for LDP³: a comprehensive post-processing framework for Local Differential Privacy (LDP). LDP³ integrates multiple post-processing techniques to enhance the utility of privatized data while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. It also includes evaluation metrics and benchmarking tools to assess different LDP protocols and post-processing strategies. Our work on LDP³ provides insights into improving the usability of LDP-collected data across various applications:
